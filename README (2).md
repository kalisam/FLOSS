## 🚀 Three Ways to Use This

### Path A: Fast Implementation (10 weeks)
**Goal**: Get IPFS working quickly

1. Read: Executive Summary + Week 1 Guide (35 min)
2. Build: Follow Week 1-10 roadmap
3. Ship: Production-ready IPFS integration

**Result**: Large files accessible, VVS-compliant, no Git LFS

### Path B: Full Stack (18 weeks) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Goal**: Complete fractal coordination infrastructure

1. Read: All documents (2.5 hours)
2. Plan: Phases 1-5 roadmap
3. Build: Core + AD4M + hREA
4. Ship: Self-coordinating intelligence substrate

**Result**: Infinite composability, cross-substrate, sustainable

### Path C: Study Then Decide
**Goal**: Understand deeply before committing

1. Read: Evolution Summary + Fractal Patterns (35 min)
2. Read: Executive Summary (15 min)
3. Read: Complete ADR (30 min)
4. Decide: Path A or B based on needs

**Result**: Informed decision, confident execution

## ✅ What Problem Does This Solve?

### The Pain
- GitHub has 100MB file limit
- Git LFS requires special tools (breaks FLOSS access)
- Large files (models, datasets) can't be shared properly

### The Solution
- Store large files in IPFS (content-addressed, distributed)
- Keep small pointer files in git (<1KB JSON)
- Anyone can download via standard HTTP (no special tools)
- Full cryptographic verification
- VVS-compliant autonomous operation

### The Bonus (with AD4M + hREA)
- Files work across different platforms (Holochain, Ceramic, etc.)
- Contributors get fair credit automatically
- Patterns work at all scales (file → dataset → model → ecosystem)
- Prevents unforeseen coordination failures
