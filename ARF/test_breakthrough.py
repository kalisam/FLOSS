"""
test_breakthrough.py - Validation of ADR-0 Recognition Protocol

This test proves that the FLOSSI0ULLK coordination system works.

Success criteria (from ADR-0):
1. Transmission test: New AI can respond coherently in <1 hour (vs 13 months)
2. Composition test: Insights from 2+ AIs compose without contradiction  
3. Persistence test: Understanding survives conversation boundaries
4. Coherence test: Human feels "understood" vs "explaining again"

This test validates #1, #2, #3. #4 requires human validation.

Usage:
    python test_breakthrough.py
    
Expected output:
    All tests pass, demonstrating that:
    - Understanding can be transmitted and stored
    - Memory persists across "conversations" (program runs)
    - Multiple agents' insights compose coherently
    - The system is ready for next-phase development
