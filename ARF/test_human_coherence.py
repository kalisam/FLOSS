test_human_coherence.py - ADR-0 Test #4: Human Coherence Validation

This is the final validation test from ADR-0:
"Does the human feel 'understood' vs 'explaining again'?"

Unlike automated tests, this requires human judgment.

This script provides a simple interface for the human to validate
whether the system has successfully captured their understanding.

Usage:
    python test_human_coherence.py

The human will be asked to rate their experience on several dimensions.
Results are logged to validate ADR-0 Test #4.
