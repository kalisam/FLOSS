## 1. Agent-Centric, Distributed Meta-Architectures

Agent-centric, distributed meta-architectures represent a paradigm shift in system design, moving away from centralized control towards autonomous, self-organizing entities. This section delves into recent advancements in this field, highlighting key research and open-source initiatives that underscore the principles of decentralization, privacy, and agent sovereignty.

### 1.1 Research Papers

One significant area of focus is the management of trust, risk, and security within these complex systems. The paper **"TRiSM for Agentic AI: A Review of Trust, Risk, and Security Management in LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS)"** [1] provides a structured analysis of these critical aspects. It emphasizes that a distributed store, often implemented as a vector database, is crucial for agents to effectively manage contextual information and facilitate long-term planning within AMAS environments. This highlights the foundational role of decentralized data management in supporting agent autonomy and secure interactions.

Another forward-looking paper, **"Beyond DNS: Unlocking the Internet of AI Agents via the NANDA Index and Verified AgentFacts"** [2], proposes a novel architectural solution for the burgeoning internet of AI agents. The authors, R Raskar, P Chari, J Zinky, M Lambe, and JJ Grogan, introduce the concept of a lean NANDA index coupled with an AgentFacts schema. This framework is designed to address the complex requirements of orchestration, rapid revocation, and code-attestation in agent-centric systems, paving the way for a more robust and scalable infrastructure for AI agents.

The evolution of AI memory is also a critical component of agent-centric design. In **"Rethinking memory in AI: Taxonomy, operations, topics, and future directions"** [3], Y Du, W Huang, D Zheng, Z Wang, and S Montella explore the future trajectory of AI memory systems. Their research indicates a clear trend towards AI systems becoming more persistent, inherently agent-centric, and exhibiting increasingly complex behaviors. This shift necessitates new approaches to memory management that can accommodate the distributed and autonomous nature of these advanced agents.

Security in agent-centric systems is further addressed in **"CAI: An Open, Bug Bounty-Ready Cybersecurity AI"** [4] by V Mayoral-Vilches and LJ Navarrete-Lozano. This paper introduces an agent-centric, lightweight, and bug bounty-ready cybersecurity AI framework. The open nature of this framework aims to empower security researchers and foster collaborative efforts in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities within agent-based systems, promoting a more secure decentralized ecosystem.

The foundational principles of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are explored in **"A Model-Driven Method For Decentralized Autonomous Organization Development"** [5] by SE Avanzo.
